        <h2>Education & Professional Development</h2>
        <p>
          My educational background reflects a unique blend of technical
          expertise in software engineering and a strong foundation in law and
          management. I have built a robust technical profile through
          specialized programs in
          <b>Computer and Information Science and Software Development</b>,
          which provides me with a deep understanding of the underlying
          architecture of the systems I test. This is further enhanced by my
          legal and management degrees, which have honed the critical thinking
          and analytical skills essential for static requirements testing and
          complex problem-solving in the QA lifecycle.

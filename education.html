    <h2>Education & Professional Development</h2>
    <p>
      My educational background reflects a unique blend of technical expertise
      in software engineering and a strong foundation in law and management. I
      have built a robust technical profile through specialized programs in
      <b>Computer and Information Science and Software Development</b>, which
      provides me with a deep understanding of the underlying architecture of
      the systems I test. This is further enhanced by my legal and management
      degrees, which have honed the critical thinking and analytical skills
      essential for static requirements testing and complex problem-solving in
      the QA lifecycle.
